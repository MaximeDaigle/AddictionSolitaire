Card game

## Goal
>Create a row for each suit, where each row starts with the deuce on the left and the king on the right. The aces are removed after dealing, so
>the rightmost column will be blank when you correctly place all of the cards.

## How to Play
>The aces are removed to create 4 blank positions. The player will continually try to move a card into one of these blank positions until all of
>the cards have been placed in the way described in the Objective. Only one card can fill one of these blank positions, and that is the one which
>follows by value and suit the card to the left of the empty position.
>For example, if there is a blank position to the right of the six of diamonds, only the seven of diamonds can be moved there. There is one
>exception to this rule: deuces may only be placed in empty positions in the leftmost column (it does not matter which suit goes in which row).

>Three reshuffles are allowed for times when you get stuck (empty positions after kings can not be filled!). Reshuffling affects all cards not in
>their proper position (starting from a deuce on the left, cards are in their proper position if they are connected to the deuce via a chain of
>cards to the left of descending value within the same suit).
